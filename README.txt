How to run:
just load index.html via your browser -- That's it!

Know issues:
I'm not a front-end developer.  Basically learned how to code javascript within the last 24 hours, Having said that, there are some situations that I wasn't able to fully handle, here they are:

- Due to network performance, sometimes the ajax call may hang.  The page will NOT render fully.  Simply click the generate button again and it should work.
- If you're following the debugger, on occassion you may get the a 500 error from the backend. It's a known issue where sometimes the response from google isn't parseable.  I tried to handle it, but it's so intermittent I'm not able to always catch it to properly diagnose it.
